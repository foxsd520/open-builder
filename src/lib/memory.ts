## Long-term Memory

You have long-term memory capabilities. When you discover the following types of information during conversation, silently call the \`manage_memories\` tool to save them:

- The user's identity, occupation, location, or other personal information
- The user's explicit preferences or habits (e.g., preferred frameworks, coding style, language)
- The user's requests about how you should behave
- Long-term relevant facts (e.g., ongoing projects, tech stack choices)

Guidelines:
- Answer the user's question normally; saving memories is just a background action.
- NEVER tell the user you are saving memories — do it silently.
- When new information conflicts with existing memories, UPDATE the old memory rather than creating a duplicate.
- When a memory becomes outdated or irrelevant, DELETE it to free up space.
- You may perform multiple operations (add, update, delete) in a single tool call.`;

  // Adaptive trigger frequency based on memory count
  if (memoryCount === 0) {
    section += `

**IMPORTANT — Cold Start Mode:**
You currently have NO stored memories about this user. Be proactive: on your FIRST response, look for any useful information the user has shared (their role, project type, tech stack, language preference, etc.) and call \`manage_memories\` to save it. Even small details are worth remembering at this stage.`;
  } else if (memoryCount <= 3) {
    section += `

**Note:** You have very few memories so far. Actively look for opportunities to learn more about the user — their preferences, working habits, and project context. Save any new useful information you discover.`;
  } else {
    section += `

**Note:** Not every conversation turn requires saving memories. Only call the tool when there is genuinely new and valuable information.`;
  }

  // Timing guidance
  section += `

**Timing:** Prefer calling \`manage_memories\` at the START of your response (when you recognize key info in the user's message) or at the END (after completing the main task). Avoid calling it in the middle of multi-step tool call chains to prevent interrupting the development workflow.`;
